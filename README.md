This is a full repository of my development environment as it currently stands. It also contains a listing of my utilities, themes, and anything else I need when setting up a new machine.

## SSH
First step is actually to get an SSH key added for the new computer so I can pull down this repo. Github has an [excellent article](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) on this.

## Browser
My current preferred browser is [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).

I use Firefox Color to theme it. [This is the theme I made.](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALjAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAVUlUkhy_b8flDkc4UL33TIxTlTBxvpqcTQaoQxwR8u1HUiiDYveh-M-eU1wzW5Co2u-jUndDeMDET1hJsyxnqtFmlLJbM4HjZDYfuJi-ER6RQB47zQ_RAHIaiLdzT1qC2SYFLXgRfirt_XCa7GyNK_RKT7gZAn0YiKiodSKK9UuWkYdSLPW4QWdeGmZyMv_-mEOAA)
