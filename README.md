## Steps

### Alfred

Github has an [excellent article](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) on this.

### Setup ZSH
I use:

## Terminal
Use the provided terminal preferences file and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as the font.

## Browser
My current preferred browser is [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).

I use Firefox Color to theme it. [This is the theme I made.](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALjAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAVUlUkhy_b8flDkc4UL33TIxTlTBxvpqcTQaoQxwR8u1HUiiDYveh-M-eU1wzW5Co2u-jUndDeMDET1hJsyxnqtFmlLJbM4HjZDYfuJi-ER6RQB47zQ_RAHIaiLdzT1qC2SYFLXgRfirt_XCa7GyNK_RKT7gZAn0YiKiodSKK9UuWkYdSLPW4QWdeGmZyMv_-mEOAA)
